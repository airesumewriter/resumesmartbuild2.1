## Recent Changes

### Node.js Deployment Migration (July 19, 2025)
- **Issue**: User requested full Node.js deployment with SendGrid integration and AI assistant preparation
- **Root Cause**: Previous Python server setup needed conversion to Node.js Express architecture
- **Resolution**: Complete migration to Node.js with minimal HTTP server architecture
- **Changes**:
  - Created `minimal_server.js` using Node.js HTTP module (no Express dependencies to avoid conflicts)
