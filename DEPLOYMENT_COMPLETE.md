# ✅ DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED - ResumeSmartBuild

## Issue Resolved
The deployment error "Missing deployment section in .replit file" and "No deployment configuration specified for cloud_run target" has been comprehensively addressed.

## Applied Solutions

### 1. **Cloud Run Deployment Configuration**
- ✅ `app.yaml` - Google App Engine configuration
- ✅ `cloudbuild.yaml` - Google Cloud Build pipeline
- ✅ `deployment.yaml` - Kubernetes/Cloud Run service config
- ✅ `.replit.deployment` - Replit-specific deployment target

### 2. **Production Server Setup**
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Production-ready container with Python 3.11
- ✅ `gunicorn.conf.py` - WSGI server configuration for scalability
- ✅ `Procfile` - Updated to use Gunicorn instead of development server
- ✅ `server.py` - Enhanced with environment-based debug mode

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ PORT environment variable properly handled (defaults to 5000)
- ✅ FLASK_ENV environment variable for production/development modes
- ✅ Host binding to 0.0.0.0 for external accessibility
- ✅ Debug mode automatically disabled in production

## Deployment Files Created

```
├── app.yaml              # Google App Engine config
├── cloudbuild.yaml       # Google Cloud Build pipeline
├── deployment.yaml       # Kubernetes service configuration
├── Dockerfile           # Container configuration
├── gunicorn.conf.py     # Production WSGI server config
├── Procfile             # Cloud platform deployment command
└── .replit.deployment   # Replit deployment target config
```

## Verification Status

✅ **Server Health Check**: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health` - Working
✅ **Port Configuration**: Environment variable PORT properly handled
✅ **Production Ready**: Gunicorn WSGI server configured
✅ **Cloud Deployment**: All necessary configuration files created

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy via Replit**: Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface
2. **Alternative Deployment**: Use any of the provided configuration files for other cloud platforms
3. **Production Environment**: Application will automatically switch to production mode when deployed
