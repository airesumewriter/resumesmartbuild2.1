# ResumeSmartBuild Deployment Guide

## Deployment Fixes Applied

✅ **Fixed Python Server Issues**
- Resolved LSP diagnostic error in article creation function
- Added proper error handling for database operations
- Fixed None iteration issue in `server.py` line 386

✅ **Removed Conflicting Server Files**
- Removed Node.js server directory (`server/`) that was causing deployment confusion
- Eliminated potential `server.js` references that were triggering deployment errors

✅ **Enhanced Deployment Configuration**
- Updated port handling to use environment variable `PORT` with fallback to 5000
- Created `main.py` as alternative entry point for deployment compatibility
- Added `Procfile` for platform deployment support

✅ **Server Verification**
- Health check endpoint working: `/api/health`
- Main application serving correctly on port 5000
- All API endpoints functional and tested

## Current Server Status
- **Technology**: Python Flask
- **Port**: 5000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (accessible externally)
- **Status**: ✅ Running and ready for deployment

- Homepage: `curl http://localhost:5000/`
- All endpoints tested and working

## Notes
- No more "run = node server.js" errors
- Python server is the single source of truth
