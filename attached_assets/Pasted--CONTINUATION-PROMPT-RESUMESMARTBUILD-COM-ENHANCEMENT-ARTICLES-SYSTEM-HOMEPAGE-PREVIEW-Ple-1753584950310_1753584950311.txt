🚀 CONTINUATION PROMPT: RESUMESMARTBUILD.COM ENHANCEMENT – ARTICLES SYSTEM + HOMEPAGE PREVIEW

Please continue building the resumesmartbuild.com platform by integrating a dynamic Article Management System as follows:

🔹 1. ARTICLES DIRECTORY SYSTEM

- Create a `/articles/` folder
- Inside, add 10 SEO-optimized HTML files named `article1.html` to `article10.html`
- Each article must be:
  - Minimum 1,000 words
  - Topic: ATS tips, resume hacks, job market trends, remote job guides, interview prep, etc.
  - Include meta title, meta description, and Schema.org article markup

🔹 2. MAIN HOMEPAGE ARTICLES PREVIEW (TEASER SECTION)

- On the main landing page (`index.html`), create an "Insights & Career Tips" section before the footer.
- Show 4 article previews using styled cards:
  - Thumbnail (placeholder or SVG-based)
  - Title
  - Short description (teaser)
  - “Read More” button → links to the full article

🔹 3. ARTICLES INDEX PAGE

- Create `articles/index.html`
- Lists all 10 articles with:
  - Thumbnail, title, short teaser
  - Date, tags (e.g., “ATS”, “Remote Work”)
  - Pagination-ready structure
- Use responsive layout (grid/flex)
- Reuse design system: Tailwind CSS + Inter font + color palette from homepage

🔹 4. LINK NAVIGATION

- Update sidebar or hamburger menu to include: `Career Articles`
- Make sure each article loads in a standalone responsive layout

🔹 5. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION

- Use clean, semantic HTML
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Avoid duplicate code blocks by modularizing repeated UI elements
- Style article teasers/cards to match the hero section and template gallery
- Recheck line by line — eliminate bugs, broken links, or missing styles
- Validate all HTML and links
- Test all 10 article links on homepage and `/articles/index.html`

🔁 Once complete, ensure that:
- Articles are crawlable by Google
- Article index uses `<article>`, `<section>`, and Schema.org tags
- The homepage previews are fast-loading (optimize images/SVGs)

🎯 Final Goal:
A fully integrated, responsive, SEO-optimized article system that enhances the resume builder platform and boosts long-term organic traffic.



🚧 ADMIN PANEL & TEMPLATE PREVIEW ENHANCEMENT — resumesmartbuild.com

Please continue the build by adding the following advanced features to complete the system:

🔹 1. ADMIN TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT PANEL

- Create `/admin/templates.html` (secured route)
- Admin can:
  - Upload new resume templates (PDF/HTML/SVG)
  - Set template name, category, recommended industries
  - Mark as “Free” or “Premium”
  - Upload thumbnail/preview image
  - See a live preview on the right panel

🔹 2. BACKEND LOGIC FOR TEMPLATE MANAGEMENT

- Extend `TEMPLATES` table schema:
  ```sql
  template_file_url VARCHAR,
  recommended_industries TEXT[],
  creation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
Save uploaded template files to server/cloud storage

Validate file type, name, and size

Save metadata to the database

Update logic to distinguish Free vs Premium for frontend rendering

🔹 3. VISITOR TEMPLATE PREVIEW MODE

For users who are not logged in:

Clicking a template shows a preview-only view

Watermark over resume

“Login to Use Template” CTA

For logged-in users:

Full access to preview + edit

Premium locked if not subscribed

🔹 4. SECURITY & ACCESS CONTROL

Restrict /admin/templates.html to logged-in users with admin role

Only allow uploads from authorized admin accounts

Secure file access paths to prevent abuse

🔹 5. UI/UX DESIGN

Use existing Tailwind + Inter + Hero UI patterns

Admin Panel layout:

Left: Form fields for upload

Right: Live preview card (renders uploaded template)

Add loading states and validation messages

🔁 FINAL CHECK

Test all uploaded templates for display on homepage

Test free vs premium logic

Confirm preview works correctly for both visitors and logged-in users

Recheck all schema fields and UI components for errors or broken links

🎯 Goal: Empower admin to manage templates without editing code and allow users to preview templates based on access level.
